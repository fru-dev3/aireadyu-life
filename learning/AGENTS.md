# AI Ready Life: Learning Plugin

## Vault Location

| OS | Vault path |
|----|------------|
| **Mac** | `~/Documents/aireadylife/vault/learning/` |
| **Windows** | `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\aireadylife\vault\learning\` |

Determine the user's OS from context (file paths they share, or ask if unclear). Use the correct path for their OS. Never use relative paths.

## First Time Setup

If `~/Documents/aireadylife/vault/learning/` does not exist or is empty:

1. Purchase the **AI Ready Life: Learning Vault** at [frudev.gumroad.com/l/aireadylife-learning](https://frudev.gumroad.com/l/aireadylife-learning)
2. Unzip the download
3. Move the `learning/` folder to `~/Documents/aireadylife/vault/`
4. Open `~/Documents/aireadylife/vault/learning/config.md` and fill in your details
5. Return here and run any skill — it will find your vault automatically

## Vault Structure

```
~/Documents/aireadylife/vault/learning/
├── config.md          — your profile and settings
├── open-loops.md      — active flags and open items
├── 00_current/        — active documents and current state
├── 01_prior/          — prior period records
└── 02_briefs/         — generated briefs and reports
```

## Skills

Skills are located under `learning/skills/` — each skill has its own folder containing a `SKILL.md` file.

## Vault Access

**Mac:** If a file read fails with a permission error, the AI tool needs filesystem access to your Documents folder. Tell the user:
> *Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access**, then add the app you are running this from:*
> - *Claude Code or Codex CLI in a terminal → add **Terminal**, **iTerm**, or **Ghostty** (whichever you use), then restart it.*
> - *Claude Desktop → add **Claude**, then restart it.*

**Windows:** No permission grant needed — terminal apps and Claude Desktop run unrestricted by default.

Do not proceed with the skill until access is confirmed (Mac) or reassure the user that no action is needed (Windows).

## First Run

Before running **any skill or flow** in this domain — including flows called by other skills — read `~/Documents/aireadylife/vault/learning/config.md` and check whether the key fields have been filled in (non-blank values after the `:`).

**Rules (follow exactly, no improvisation):**

1. **Vault folder is missing entirely** → output only: *"Your learning vault isn't installed. Download it at [frudev.gumroad.com/l/aireadylife-learning](https://frudev.gumroad.com/l/aireadylife-learning), unzip, and place the `learning/` folder at `~/Documents/aireadylife/vault/`."* Stop.

2. **Config fields are blank** (empty after `:`) → output the First-Run Message below verbatim. Stop. Do **not** scaffold files, offer alternatives, or ask questions.

3. **Config is filled in** → proceed with the requested skill normally.

### First-Run Message

> **Welcome to AI Ready Life: Learning!**
>
> Your vault is installed at:
> - **Mac:** `~/Documents/aireadylife/vault/learning/`
> - **Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\aireadylife\vault\learning\` Before skills can run, your config and documents need to be in place.
>
> **Step 1 — Complete your config**
> Open `~/Documents/aireadylife/vault/learning/config.md` and fill in every field. Leave a field blank rather than guessing — the skills will flag anything that's missing.
>
> **Step 2 — Gather your documents and add them to `00_current/`**
> Here's what this domain needs:
>
- **Active courses** — platform (Coursera, Udemy, etc.), course name, enrollment date, and current completion percentage.
- **Books in progress** — title, author, format (physical/Kindle/audio), and current progress (chapter or percentage).
- **Recently completed** — courses or books finished in the past 90 days with key takeaways.
- **Learning goals** — skills you want to develop this year, with target milestones and deadlines.
- **Certifications in progress (optional)** — certification name, exam date, and study schedule.
>
> **Step 3 — Run your first skill**
> Once config.md is filled in and at least a few documents are in `00_current/`, try: *"learning review"*
>
> You don't need everything perfect to start — add what you have and the skills will tell you what's still missing.
>
> **Stop here.** Do not scaffold files, do not offer options, do not ask questions. Wait for the user to complete setup and re-run the skill.

## Skill Index

Skills live in `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`. To run a skill, read its `SKILL.md` and follow the instructions inside.

**Apps (data connectors — fallback when no native MCP connector available):**
- **`app-coursera`** — Tracks enrolled course progress, completion percentages, certificate status, and upcoming assignment deadlines on Coursera via Playwright with Chrome cookie session.
- **`app-kindle`** — Accesses Kindle reading progress and highlights via Amazon's Manage Content page or Goodreads RSS sync.

**Operations (user-facing routines):**
- **`op-monthly-theme-set`** — Monthly (1st). Picks one named theme with chosen resource, planned applied output, deadline, and weekly milestones. Single-thread discipline.
- **`op-monthly-sync`** — Full monthly process: platform refresh, reading sync, certification timeline, unified pace review (absorbs former `op-progress-review`), goal vs actual, monthly brief.
- **`op-monthly-reflection`** — End-of-month qualitative reflection: what was learned, what changed, what blocked, what's next. Distinct from pace review.
- **`op-goal-review`** — Quarterly alignment of the active learning portfolio against career and life-vision priorities.
- **`op-review-brief`** — Weekly lightweight learning snapshot — pace, current book, streak, next actions.

**Flows (multi-step internals called by ops):**
- **`flow-build-learning-summary`** — Unified pace + per-type rollup across courses, certifications, books, papers, projects. Replaces former `flow-build-progress-summary` + `flow-build-reading-summary`.
- **`flow-build-streak-summary`** — Daily/weekly study consistency: current streak, longest streak, weekday/weekend split, target adherence.
- **`flow-scan-emerging-sources`** — Field-agnostic horizon scan from user-configured sources (RSS, newsletters, arxiv, podcasts, conferences). Ranks 5–10 emerging topics.
- **`flow-language-learning-progress`** *(v2)* — Per-language vocabulary, app streak, CEFR self-eval, practice minutes by skill. Only if a language is configured.

**Tasks (atomic operations called by flows / ops):**
- **`task-log-applied-output`** — Records the artifact (project, repo, post, certification, talk, deck, app) that proves a learned skill was applied.
- **`task-track-learning-budget`** — Logs spend against a user-configured budget cap (employer stipend, personal annual, tuition reimbursement). Flags 90 / 30-day expiry. Skips cleanly when no budget configured.
- **`task-update-reading-list`** — Single canonical reading queue across books, articles, papers, posts. Hygiene rules cap stale and high-priority items.
- **`task-log-conference-workshop`** — Conference / workshop / meetup attendance log with takeaways, contacts, follow-ups. Cross-pollinates social.
- **`task-capture-note`** — Atomic note capture into vault (with optional Obsidian / Notion mirror). Theme + source tags.
- **`task-link-learning-to-domain`** — Tags a learning item with the life domain it serves; writes a one-line application note to that domain.
- **`task-mentor-mentee-log`** *(v2)* — Per-meeting log for mentor / mentee / coaching relationships. Action items + reciprocity check.
- **`task-flag-falling-behind`** — Behind-pace alert with recovery calculation (>15-point pace deficit).
- **`task-log-completion`** — Records a completed course, certification, or book with takeaways, rating, hours invested, and credential.
- **`task-update-open-loops`** — Single write point for `open-loops.md`.
