## Vault Status Check (All Domains)

Before running any skill across any domain, check:
1. Does `vault/{domain}/config.md` exist?
2. Are the required config fields filled in (not blank)?

If vault is missing → tell user which domain is missing and link to the Gumroad purchase.
If config is blank → prompt user to complete setup before proceeding.
