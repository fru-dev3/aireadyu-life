## How It Works

Each plugin has two parts:

**1. The vault** — your personal data, stored locally on your machine.

```
~/Documents/AIReadyLife/vault/
├── health/
│   ├── config.md       ← your profile and settings
│   ├── 00_current/     ← active documents
│   ├── 01_prior/       ← historical records
│   └── 02_briefs/      ← generated reports
├── wealth/
├── tax/
└── ...
```

**2. The plugin** — installed in Claude Desktop, reads your vault and runs skills against it.

```
~/Documents/AIReadyLife/domains/
├── health/             ← installed from this repo
├── wealth/
└── ...
```

## Setup

### Step 1 — Get your vault template

Purchase the vault template for your domain on Gumroad. Each domain has its own listing at `frudev.gumroad.com/l/aireadylife-{domain}`.

Unzip the download and place the vault folder at:

```
~/Documents/AIReadyLife/vault/{domain}/
```

Open `config.md` and fill in your details.

### Step 2 — Install the plugin in Claude Desktop

1. Open Claude Desktop → Settings → Integrations
2. Add this GitHub repo as a project source: `fru-dev3/aireadyu-life`
3. Set your project folder to `~/Documents/AIReadyLife/`

The plugin reads your vault automatically via the path in `config.md`.

### Step 3 — Run your first skill

Open Claude and try:

```
Give me a health brief
What's my net worth?
Am I on track with my taxes?
Review my career pipeline
```

## Vault Templates

Vault templates are sold separately on Gumroad. Each template includes:

- `config.md` — blank profile ready to fill in
- `00_current/` — your active working folder
- `01_prior/` — organized by year (2023, 2024, 2025)
- `02_briefs/` — where the agent writes its reports
- `get-started/QUICKSTART.md` — setup guide
- `get-started/PROMPTS.md` — ready-to-use prompt library
