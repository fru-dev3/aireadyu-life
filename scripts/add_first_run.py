## First Run

Before running any skill, check `~/Documents/AIReadyLife/vault/{domain}/config.md`:

1. **Vault missing** → tell the user to purchase the vault template and link to the Gumroad listing above.
2. **Config filled in** → proceed with the requested skill normally.
3. **Config exists but fields are blank** (values empty after the `:`) → do NOT run the skill. Show the first-run message below instead.

### First-Run Message (show when config is blank)

> **Welcome to AI Ready Life: {domain.replace("-", " ").title()}!**
>
> Your vault is installed at `~/Documents/AIReadyLife/vault/{domain}/`. Before skills can run, your config and documents need to be in place.
>
> **Step 1 — Complete your config**
> Open `~/Documents/AIReadyLife/vault/{domain}/config.md` and fill in every field. Leave a field blank rather than guessing — the skills will flag anything that's missing.
>
> **Step 2 — Gather your documents and add them to `00_current/`**
> Here's what this domain needs:
>
{doc_lines}
>
> **Step 3 — Run your first skill**
> Once config.md is filled in and at least a few documents are in `00_current/`, try: *"{d["trigger"]}"*
>
> You don't need everything perfect to start — add what you have and the skills will tell you what's still missing.
